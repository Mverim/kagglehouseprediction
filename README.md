House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques competition from the Kaggle

  This project was created in order to complete a homework given by my professor
at university during the Int.to Artificial Intelligence lecture and it aims to 
finish the Kaggle competition revolving around house prices.

  The coding process was mainly done on Colab by Google because of notebook style
of debugging easifies the overall process of inspecting data and see results.
